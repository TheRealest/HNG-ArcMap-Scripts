# Name: OneCall_Buffer-Intersect.py
# Author: RÃ©al R. Provencher 2011
# Description: Creates a polygon shapefile with buffers around each line in the Gas_Lines layer, then splits these buffers along county lines. Each set of country buffers is exported to its own dated shapefile and zipped. These zips should be emailed to OneCall to serve as our dig safe areas.
