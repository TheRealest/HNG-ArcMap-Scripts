# Name: Count_Line_Length.py
# Author: RÃ©al R. Provencher 2013
# Description: Splits gas lines layer (only HNG lines) along RRC area borders and counts length of all lines in each area. Generates a .csv table to report the data.
# NOTE: An updated version of this script has been incorporated into the Data_Integrity_Report.py maintenance script
