# Geoprocessing scripts for ArcMap with `arcpy`
This set of scripts is used by Hughes Natural Gas Inc. (HNG) for a variety of data analysis and management tasks, from routine database maintenance to report generation to Excel table formatting. All rely heavily on the `arcpy` library by ESRI for manipulating geographic data and related customer and gas meter information, as well as the `csv` standard Python library for working with Excel files and tables outside of the geodatabase.
