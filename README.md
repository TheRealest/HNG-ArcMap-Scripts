# Geoprocessing scripts for ArcMap with `arcpy`
This set of scripts is used by Hughes Natural Gas Inc. (HNG) for a variety of data analysis and management tasks, from routine database maintenance to report generation to Excel table formatting. All rely heavily on the `arcpy` library by ESRI for manipulating geographic data and related customer and gas meter information, as well as the `csv` standard Python library for working with Excel files and tables outside of the geodatabase.

All scripts must be run on the internal HNG server to be able to access the appropriate customer database and geodatabase, and require an ArcMap Basic level license or higher to run.

All code written by RÃ©al Provencher and owned by HNG, copyright 2011-2015.
